# line_follower
A simple line follower robot using Arduino UNO rev3 board

 * The whole project is built using the following - 
 * Arduino Uno rev3 board
 * An arduino motor sheild which is used to control 2 DC geared motors (12V, 300rpm,300mA) 
 * 3 IR sensor module connected to analog pins(they can be also used to get digital input
 * Arduino board and motor sheild are powered seperately from different sources
 * Arduino board gets a input from a 9V batter from either the DC input jack(better option because of protection diode) or the Vin pin
 * Don't forget to remove the jumper when using seperate power supplies
 * Motor sheild is powered by a battery of 1.5V cells (12V total) using the EXT_PWR pins on the sheild.
 * The chassis is made using acrylic plexiglass sheets with two decks for the boards and battery seperately
